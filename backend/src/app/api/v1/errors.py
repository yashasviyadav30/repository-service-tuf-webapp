"""What a failure looks like, declared so a consumer can read it.

More than one route fails in the same few ways, and each failure carries a
message written for a person. Declaring them here puts those shapes in the
OpenAPI document, which is what the interface generates its types from:
undeclared, the error path is the one part of the contract a consumer has to
guess at, and the error path is most of what this service exists to report.

The codes follow one rule. Broken trust is the subject of this service, so an
expired or badly signed repository is a normal answer carrying a status, not
a failure. A request for a role that does not exist is the caller's mistake.
Only a repository that cannot be reached, or one that cannot be checked at
all, is reported as a failure of the service.
