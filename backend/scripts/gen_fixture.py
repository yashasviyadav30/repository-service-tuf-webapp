"""Generate a small, correctly signed TUF repository for local testing.

Creates three variants under ``fixtures/``:

    good/       every role valid and in date
    expired/    same keys, but timestamp already past its expiry
    tampered/   a signed file edited after signing, so its signature fails

The key arrangement mirrors a real RSTUF repository: root is held offline,
and one shared online key signs everything else. Keys carry the readable
names RSTUF records, so the interface can show names instead of hashes.

Root is published in three versions rather than one. A client is handed the
first and walks forward to the third, so every refresh exercises the rotation
rule rather than accepting the file it was given.

Run it with the project's virtualenv active::

    python scripts/gen_fixture.py

Serve one of the variants over HTTP and point RSTUF_METADATA_URL at it.
